# SuperBatCode Coming Soon Website Source Code and Extras

The following repository contains two directories named as

- SBCComingSoonWebsite
- SBCComingSoonWebsite_EXTRA

### SBCComingSoonWebsite

The SBCComingSoonWebsite contains the main source code of the entire website, with nearly each line of code commented
for easily grasping the code, and using the website source code as a reference to learn and to create a similar website.
The source code has been licensed under the [GNU GPLv3 License] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt), so feel free to 
use the source code in your website, giving proper credit to the creators (in this case, the members at SuperBatCode). 
The reason being so because the members of SuperBatCode know of people who take themes and templates and claim that work 
to be their very own, without giving due credit where it is owed.

The SBCComingSoonWebsite directory contains the following sub-directories (which are relevant to the working of the website)

- SBCComingSoonWebsite
	- css
	- dist
	- fonts
	- images
	- js
	- mp3
	- swf

The entire website has been made on IntelliJ Idea Community Edition 13.1.3 Build:135.909. One can download it at
[IntelliJ IDE] (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Once the IDE has been downloaded and installed, open the
SBCComingSoon.iml file in the SBCComingSoonWebsite directory, and start hacking/learning away at the code.

### SBCComingSoonWebsite_EXTRA

The SBCComingSoonWebsite_EXTRA directory contains the .png, .jpeg, .psd and .ai files which were used in the images
for creation of the website. Two files that have been exluded as teh SBC logo psd, since it is proprietary and the
template used for creation of comic book styled images in Adobe Photoshop, the reason beging similar to the former.
The files are licensed under [GNU GPLv3 License] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) license, so feel free to 
modify the PSD, though by giving proper credit to the authors (SuperBatCode Members) wherever it is owed.

The SBCComingSoonWebsite directory contains the following sub-directories

- SBCComingSoonWebsite
	- bg-arrow
	- comics
	- forFavicon
	- SBCWebsiteButtonComingSoon
